# IEEECompetition
This is the repo for IEEE Pitch Competition codes and files storage 

To run the code, you will need

1) Open CV (for windows: py -m pip install opencv-python)
2) numpy (for windows: py -m pip install numpy)
3) MediaPipe (for windows: pip install mediapipe) 

Note: Both squat and lateral raise code are essentially the same except for the angle calculation and display.
